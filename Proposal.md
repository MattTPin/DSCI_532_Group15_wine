# Wine Reviews
## 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role**: Wine sales company               
**Target audience**: Wine consumers

For wine lovers, looking around for good value wine among billion kinds of wines is not possible. It could also spend too much money and effects health to choose the good tasting wine. To help the wine customers obtain more information and shop smarter, we are building a wine review app to help customers visually explore the wine quality based on the 100-point wine scoring system. Our app will allow users to rank wines on different aspects and get summary information about wines.

## 2: Data Description

We will be visualizing a dataset of approximately 130,000 wine reviews. Each review has 14 associated variables that describe the testers who test this wine (tester_name, tester_twitter), the title (a title) of the description (a description) and 1-100 range points(points) given by this tester, production locations(country, province, region1, region2), the wine price(price),  and the place where the grapes that made the wine are from(winery, designation). Using this data we will also derive a new variable, which is the wine variety we can identify through blind tasting like a master sommelier would (variety).

## 3: Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

Camilla is a 37-year-old office lady who fancies herself something of a wine connoisseur. She is interested in purchasing a variety of different wines for a wine tasting party that she will be hosting for her like minded coworkers (she’s been saving for months for this event). In order to build a solid selection for her guests she hopes to identify an assortment of different types of wines to suit everyone’s tastes. She wants the collection of wines at her party to be from multiple different countries, consist of a variety of different blends and to represent different price ranges. Finally, since Camilla wants to impress everyone, she wants to only purchase the wines that are perceived as good by other consumers. She wants to explore a database containing a large collection of wines so that she can identify some unique and unknown wines that the attendees of her party likely have not previously tried.         

By using our dashboard she hopes to be able to identify the collection of wines that she will be purchasing for her party. The first thing she does is adjusts the WineEnthusiast score slider on the dashboard to only include wines with a score of 90 or higher. The first kind of wine she wants to find is something foreign and expensive to impress her guests. She clicks a filter to make sure that no wine from the United States or Canada is included in her search and sets her price range to be $70 or higher. Next, she wants to provide something more familiar to her guests, so she inverts her filter and finds a Pinot Gris bottled in the United States in her home state of California within a price range of $30 to $50. Finally, she wants her last wine to have gotten a positive review from one of her favorite reviewers and to have a vintage between 2013 and 2015 so she searches for her favorite reviewer and sets the vintage range. Finally, she can now throw the wine tasting party of her dreams!
