# Wine Review Data Visualization Team Project
Deployed dashboard in herokuapp: https://winevalley.herokuapp.com/

The left side of the screen will display interactive sliders (vintage year, price, user rating) and drop down (country, variety) menus for different search criteria as well as a keyword search bar to look for wine of a specific name. The bottom left of the screen will display an interactive map highlighting where all of the searched wines are from. The upper middle of the screen will display the results of the search as a scrollable list of wine that meet the specified criteria, with the title and some summary information about each wine visible. A dropdown will be available at the top to change how these results are sorted (i.e. by price, score, etc.). If a wine is clicked on by the user a detailed description will be displayed in the top right of the screen including detailed information about each wine and it's provided review. Finally, the lower right of the screen will show summary statistics (i.e. histograms, line charts) about the search results with a dropdown menu to let you decide what features (price, score, etc.) are displayed by the charts.
