# Wine Review Data Visualization Team Project

The dashboard will be designed with usability in mind. The left side of the screen will display interactive sliders (vintage, price, user rating) and drop down (country, variety) menus for different search criteria as well as a keyword search bar to look for wine of a specific name. The bottom left will display an interactive map of where all of the different search results are from. The middle of the screen will show the results of the search within a scrollable section to see all results, displaying summary information about each wine (price, user rating, country, vintage). A dropdown will be available at the top to change how the results are sorted (i.e. by price, score, etc.). If a wine is clicked on a detailed description will show up in the top right including all of the summary information, the description, information about the winery/province, and potentially a picture and link to Vivino. Finally, the lower right of the screen will show statistics (i.e. histograms, line charts) about the search results with a dropdown menu to let you see info about different statistics (price, score, etc.). The proposal of the project is here
